        <p><h1>At The Threshold: Toward Jettisoning the Frame </h1></p>
            <p>In 1971, a film written and directed by Charles and Ray Eames called <i>The Powers of Ten </i>was released. The project’s goal was to depict “the relative size of things in the universe.” It begins with a ground level shot of a man and woman setting up a picnic on what we are told is the Chicago lakefront. The camera then switches to an aerial view, framing both figures—the man now sleeping on his back and the woman sitting up and reading a book—before zooming in to a tighter frame of one square meter. Black borders appear with text that indicates the scale of the video frame in intervals of both meters and relative powers of 10, beginning with the interval of 100. At this scale, the woman is now cropped out of the frame and the man is centered. His left hand rests on a book, The Voices of Time by J. T. Fraser, and another book lays to his right with the word science visible on its cover. </p>
            <p>	Departing from this scene, the frame begins to expand at a rate of one power of ten every 10 seconds. A blue box marks each interval, containing the park, then the city, then the whole earth as the scale progressively increases. The intervals grow until the frame reaches 1024 meters, and contains the known universe. After a pause, the intervals decrease and we return to the scale of 1 square meter (100). The man on the picnic blanket is once again visible but now we are zooming into his hand, passing through skin, cells, and molecules until protons and then finally vibrating quarks fill the screen at 10-16 meters. The film ends here, taking only 9 minutes to represent the universe. Despite the immense shifts in scale, viewing <i>The Powers of Ten</i> isn't disorienting or vertigo inducing. It’s use of a static frame and vertical perspective produces a representation of the universe that is surprisingly stable. 	</p>
            <p>The film<i> </i>suggests a total view of the universe, but if you were able to shift the frame of the by just 1 square meter in any direction, you might see that most of the universe is actually left out. For example, during the nine minutes that we traverse space and time, we don’t know what is happening to the woman who was sharing the blanket with the man. When the film began, she was sitting up and reading a book. After the frame traveled to the edge of the universe and back, she is seen lying on her side next to a closed book. What happened to her? Did she get bored and fall asleep? Was she the target of a violent crime? Was she daydreaming? It’s impossible to know. Her story was cropped out, censored from our view while the frame centered on the man, expanding and contracting in multitudes.</p>
            <p>The origins of<i> The Powers of Ten </i>reveals the use of design as a strategy to produce profitable narratives around science and technology. The film was commissioned by IBM as part of a broader educational programming project. According to a section of the IBM website titled <i>Popularizing Math and Science</i>: </p>
            <p>“In the 1950s, IBM engaged the husband-and-wife design duo, Charles and Ray Eames—known largely for their innovations in the design of chairs—to create a series of educational films and exhibits. These pieces didn’t sell anything or mention IBM or its products. Instead, they sought to translate mathematical and scientific concepts into engaging learning experiences for general audiences.”</p>
            <p>Despite taking the form of various mediums, the programming was understood internally as a design project. This is clear in IBM’s online materials, which state that “this deeper, long-term educational mission was central to [CEO’s] Watson Jr.’s notion that ‘good design is good business.’ And central to that mission was the work of the Eameses.’” Watson Jr. admission that design benefits IBM’s bottom line reveals that the educational programming was profitable and implies that design is uniquely equipped to achieving the goals of the corporation.</p>
            <p><strong>Representing the Universe: Static Frames and Vertical Perspectives</strong></p>
            <p>Design, through its use of perspective and framing, enabled IBM to represent the universe on profitable terms. Representation, or the ability to depict a reality, system, or subject is always an act of construction that is entangled with power. In <i>Power Plays Power Works</i>, John Fiske establishes a foundation for considering representation as an always mediated reality:</p>
            <p>“a representation presents again selected features of an absent ‘reality’ or referent. By presenting us with particular experience or knowledge of the real a representation actually produces that reality, for our experience/knowledge of it becomes reality-for-us. Reality is always represented, we cannot access it raw: it never exists on its own term, but is always ‘reality-for-someone.”  </p>
            <p><i>The Powers of Ten </i>was an opportunity for IBM to produce a representation of a reality that would benefit itself as a multinational technology company. Through various strategies, including the use of design, the film<i> </i>depicts the universe as broadly knowable, calculable, and therefore subject to be acted on. As Fiske argues, “being able to see or know is not just a prerequisite for control, it is part of that control.”  For IBM, a known universe is one that is also terrain for investment, extraction, or profit. An analysis of the formal strategies used in <i>The Powers of Ten</i> clarifies how design and its innate representational strengths produced a reality-for-IBM. </p>
            <p>	In the film<i>, </i>the Eameses employ two key formal strategies, vertical perspective and a static, implicit frame. Both of these constructs a powerful politics and imaginary relationships between the observer and subject. <i>In</i> <i>Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective</i>, Hito Steyerl explains that linear perspective imagines a stable horizon line and observer. The spatial relationships created by this abstraction has material implications:</p>
            <p>“The use of the horizon to calculate position gave seafarers a sense of orientation, thus also enabling colonialism and the spread of a capitalist global market, but also became an important tool for the construction of the optical paradigms that came to define modernity, the most important paradigm being that of so-called linear perspective.”</p>
            <p>While both linear and vertical perspective are based on visual abstractions, they are perceived as natural, scientific, and objective. This lends both perspectives authority and divorce them from subjectivity.  Where linear perspective is predicated on a stable horizon and observer, vertical perspective produces the illusion of a flattened ground with an imaginary observer floating above. </p>
            <p>In <i>The Powers of Ten</i>, the Eames position the observer above the frame, suspended in a position of superiority. The vertical perspective suggests an objective, authoritative, and scientific representation of the world. In reality, this is often an abstraction, constructed from a stitched together, flattened, and imagined ground. Alex Funke, a cinematographer and effects artist who worked on the <i>The Powers of Ten</i>, explains that the film was produced by stitching and overlapping images taken from various sources. This process results in a distorted, altered representation: </p>
            <p>“There was also a lot of airbrushing to be done. For example, the photos from the Chicago Aerial Survey were a tiny bit askew. The airplanes weren’t exactly looking down on the landmarks, so we had to do a perspective adjustment. Part of that was done by tilting the paper when the prints were being made to skew the perspective.”</p>
            <p>In addition to this artificially constructed ground, vertical perspective further distorts the subject by flattening it. Eames Demetrios, a grandson of Charles and Ray and principal of the Eames Office explains this phenomenon: </p>
            <p>“One of the funny things about when you go to the site in Chicago is that it's actually on a swell. You’re so used to seeing it in the movie with everything flattened out. The footage of Chicago is actually the most disguised illusion of the whole film.”</p>
            <p>In the same way linear perspective constructed the illusion of an artificial horizon and stable observer, vertical perspective creates a stitched, flattened ground and suspended observer. The presentation of these fabricated images as an objective or scientific reality benefits IBM (<i>how?</i>). Design, and particularly graphic design, has used vertical perspective long before it became a dominant form of visuality. </p>
            <p>Whereas other mediums like painting, film, or photography used linear perspective as a way to construct spatial abstractions, depth, or compositions, graphic design’s relationship with its medium and audience resulted in an embrace of vertical perspective before technology widely enabled it. In this case of a book, the content of a page is arranged in a way which imagines the observer looking down from above. Text, image, or illustration are flattened onto the page, creating an imaginary ground similar to the one constructed by vertical perspective. Instead of a horizon line and vanishing point, graphic design uses a system of grids, margins, columns, and frames as a way of organizing content and composition. </p>
            <p>One outcome of graphic design’s inherent relationship with a vertical perspective is the production of maps. They enact a similar politics to a vertical perspective, by flattening a subject and positioning a viewer in a position of power in relationship to it. Fiske writes that “Maps are powerful discourse, for they bring together science and representation to function as explicit instruments of control.” They also operate with the authority of scientific objectivity despite being predicated on visual abstractions. The mercator map, for example, is well documented as enabled colonial and imperial projects by centering western nations while abstracting, distorting, and marginalizing other parts of the world. </p>
            <p>
            “Europeans mapped the world as they explored, exploited and colonized it. .The maps produced by mercator’s project, his scientific way of representing a globe on a flat surface, have become part of Wesetern common sense because they represent, no just the world, but Western power in and over it.” </p>
            <p>[This paragraph needs to be wrapped up.]</p>
            <p>When drones, satellites, and other aerial lenses enabled the widespread use of vertical perspective, it shifted the substrate of graphic design—replacing the page or the screen with an artificially constructed ground. Parameters like page size, margins, or screen size were subsumed by street widths, building rooftops, and plots of land. This marked a shift or evolution from the use of graphic design in the production of maps, which only imagined an aerial audience. Maps are abstractions that don’t actually have to be printed at a 1 to 1 scale, although they can have material implications proportional to the land or surface they represent that are visible from above, such as state borders or city grids. In contrast, aerial audiences require content to actually be printed or produced at a scale legible to lenses floating above. For example, a logo that would have previously only been printed at human scale on products or stationary might now be printed on the roof of a building in order to be legible to aerial audiences. </p>
            <p>The production of graphic design at this near-planetary scale has political implications. During the George Floyd Protests, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser had the phrase "Black Lives Matter" painted in yellow, 35-foot-tall capital letters on the asphalt of a street in front of the white house. The text was designed to address a vertical audience—early sketches of the project used google maps satellite imagery, and the message only fully legible if observed from above. By engaging an audience removed from the local context, Mayor Bowser was able to perform solidarity and gain national and global recognition while erasing the violence her local, pro-police policies enacted. For many living in Washington D.C., the painted message was an abstraction that conflicted with the Mayor’s funding and support of the D.C. police force. On twitter, the Black Lives Matter DC group articulated this disconnect, stating “this is a performative distraction from real policy changes. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.” In an attempt to reclaim the message, protestors edited the text on the street, painting "Defund the Police" in the same yellow block letters used by the city. An equal sign was also added by painting over a group of stars. The new message read: "Black Lives Matter = Defund The Police." By editing the text, protesters were able to temporarily contest the message but not able to shift it’s orientation towards an aerial audience. To be represented from above is to be flattened, dehumanized, and otherwise made vulnerable to politics of vertical perspective. Graphic design adapts to this scale and is complicit in the violence that is enacted or, in the case of the street mural in D.C., covered up.</p>
            <p>Implementing graphic design at a scale legible to aerial audiences can also be a way to resist or contest vertical representations. In the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, artists collaborated with local residents on a project called #NotABugSplat, which attempts to confront the dehumanizing perspective of the drone. The project’s title references the military slang used by predator drone operators to describe people who are killed on the ground. Artist produced a massive poster that depicted the face of a child who lost both her parents and two young siblings in a drone attack. The scale of poster was scaled with the intent it would be visible by drone or satellite. According to the project materials, “humans appear as disposable bugs when viewed through a traditional drone camera. We changed this. Now, a drone will see the actual face of a child, creating dialogue, and possibly, empathy.” </p>
            <p>	In a project called <i>Geochoreographies</i>, artist Carolina Caycedo collaborates with communities along the Magdalena river in southern Colombia to respond to the construction and consequences of the El Quimbo Dam. A form of Caycedo describes as “colonial infrastructure,” the El Quimbo Dam threatens to fracture, undermine, or otherwise damage the livelihood of local communities and ecologies. In protest and resistance to this infrastructure, Caycendo choreographs photographs taken by drones in which communities lie on the ground and use their bodies to spell out messages of protest or resistance. According to Caycedo, these “everyday geochoreographies humanize the landscape, countering the dehumanizing effects of the dam.” The images contrast with the satellite imagery that enabled the construction of the Dam. In order to insist on their humanity and contest the representation that enabled colonial interventions, participants in Caycedo’s images must transform their bodies into letterforms. </p>
            <p>	[summarize vertical perspective and graphic design - transition to frame ] </p>
            <p>To return to <i>The Powers of Ten, </i>and having analyzed vertical perspective and its relationship with graphic design, the other main representation at play in the film is the static frame. If perspective operates in the construction of the subject and position of the observer, then the frame is the container for this construction. It marks the edges of what’s represented. In <i>The Powers of Ten, </i>the content shifts, zooming in and out, but the frame doesn’t change. This mirrors how graphic designers treat frames in practice. For example, if you place an image into a frame in Adobe Indesign, the frame remains static and the designer can click and drag to shift the image position or scale. This content-frame relationship produces a dynamic in which the frame is implicit and the content is explicit. </p>



            <p> In terms of the film and representation more broadly, this produces an uncontested and authoritative frame. If you don’t acknowledge the frame, you’re also failing to acknowledge the act of framing, of what is included, what is excluded, and who is producing the frame. </p>

            <p>The film doesn’t hint at what may be excluded or escape from this frame or perspective. It’s not challenged by other frames or perspectives. In <i>Frames of War</i>, Judith Butler argues that the convention of framing is implicit to representation, overriding content:</p>
            <p>“we cannot understand the field of representability simply by examining its explicit contents, since it is constituted fundamentally by what is left out, maintained outside the frame within which representations appear. We can think of the frame, then, as active, as both jettisoning and presenting, and as doing both at once.” </p>
            <p>What are the politics of this? If we don’t acknowledge the frame we don’t acknowledge what’s left out. The woman, for example, is left outside of the frame.What does exist outside of most frames? In violence at the threshold of detectability, Eyal Weizman examines thresholds, a corollary to the frame. A threshold is x. Taking Satellite imagery and drone attacks in Palestine as an example (link this to perspective), Weizman argues that violence often takes place just beyond the threshold of detectability, just outside of the frame. The example he gives is the limits of satellite imagery. The Isreali military, Weizman explains, used missiles that produced entry holes that are smaller than the pixels produced by the satellite images. Just beyond the frame of the pixel is the act of violence. In this example, two formal devices inherent to graphic design work together. The illusion of vertical perspective and the power of the frame. </p>
            <p>	It’s seeking to understand the relationship of graphic design to the frame, it’s useful to draw on other fields that have more robust bodies of theory around the subject. The act of an implicit frame, and critique of the frame, is well documented in the field of archives. In <i>The Powers of Ten, </i>the film’s explicit goal is to show the scale of everything in the universe. We’ve discussed how the implicit goal is to present all of the universe as calculable, mapped, and known. This can be seen as a parallel to desire in archives or museums to map or collect all of something. The myth of the complete archive or the complete map (include those to examples here of the complete archive and map.) Of course these are impossible. “The complete archive is mythological, possible only in theory" Although this hasn’t stopped some actual attempts, many linked directly to the field of graphic design (example of google books. Less direct comparison could be the google font.) Archives have also been treated as invisible frames. In reality, similar to Weizman’s configuration, the act of framing is always political and often enacting a form of violence in what is left out. "What is placed in or left out of the archive is a political act, dictated by the archivist and the political context in which she lives."</p>
            <p>The question of what is and is not included within a frame is also pressing concern in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and specifically within an area called deep learning. If artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to think and learn like humans, then deep learning in a core process that enables this by tackling tricky problems. Some tasks that are easy for humans -- such as identifying an image, are very difficult for machines because they require a sophisticated combination of objective and subjective information. Deep learning is the process of breaking those difficult tasks down into more manageable pieces. For example, an image identification program needed to sort images of tanks, then instead of identifying the tank as whole, deep learning might use a layered model that allows the system to identify individual parts or arrangements of pixels, such as corners and contours of the tank body, or tank cannon barrels. This process enables the deep learning model to break the complexity of the image down into manageable pieces. The process is made possible by a series of thresholds, which are variables that the model sets to determine what is or is not a tank (or a piece of a tank). Functions as an accumulation of frames, each one excluding spam from the dataset. </p>
            <p>Thresholds act like frames, including or excluding certain data. Because this process is embedded within the deep learning model as well as the artificial intelligence model, scientists or engineers are able to distance themselves from the act of setting the threshold or frame. (need some supporting material here) It gives the appearance of neutrality or objectivity. </p>
            <p>Graphic design is unique in its unique investment in objectivity, scientific authority, and solutionism. These qualities are born, in part, from a legacy of science and technology, and while they make design a powerful tool, they also will lead to its undermining. </p>
            <p>The film<i> </i>would suggest that good design is a powerful frame, capable of progressing certain narratives and excluding others while maintaining an objectivistic attitude</p>

            <p>Design’s marriage to science and technology is what makes this possible.)</p>
            <p>In the history of graphic design, the emergence of industrial production marks the decoupling of design from individual subjectivity and an appeal to systematization, logic, and the dream of the universal.</p>


            <p>“Realism, as a mode of representation, is particularly characteristic of Western cultures and, therefore, in the modern world, of capitalism. It is as powerful and attractive as it is because it grounds our cultural identity in external reality: by making “us” seem real it who we think we are into who we “really” are. To achieve this, it must “know” reality in the way that science “knows” it, as an objective universal whole existence and truck are independent of culture.”    </p>

            <p>It’s clear what corporations like IBM gain, what does the designer gain? The designer gains authority, legitimacy, and respect. They are able to play the savior and perform solutionism while also being absolved from any political, social or cultural implications. </p>
            <p>There is also profit to be made for the designer in the exchange, although very little compared to the institutions and corporations they serve.. The same forces which benefit the designer also promises their demise. The investment in technology and forfeiture of the means of production has left the designer vulnerable. Adobe and apple control most of the designers' tools. The field’s investment in systematization has left it vulnerable to automation. The designer too, same as the rest of the world, is positioned as conquerable and as a site of extraction. The longer we invest in this type of designer role, the more precarious the position of the design  becomes, as the risk of the automation increases and the power of Adobe/apple continue to strip the means of production, the designer is ever more dependent on the illusion of authority this matrix provides. </p>
            <p>This is evidenced at RISD by the students having to appeal to the frame of STEM in order to be protected. The position of these students is incredibly precocious, and the institution can no longer protect them. By appealing to the authority of science, technology, and math over the arts, criticism, or other liberal arts pedagogies, institutions like RISD and the students it represents only reinforce that myth. We have sown our own destruction. Soon, once the frames of the designer can be automated or easily reproduced, the frame will shift entirely, seeking new territories of extraction. The designer(s) will then experience the violence that lays beyond the threshold of detectability. This is not to say this will be evenly distributed. The white man will likely be better off than his Asian, female counterpart who was already outside of the frame to begin with.</p>

            <p><strong>Explainability Crisis </strong></p>

            <p>The original mission of IBM’s educational programming was “to translate mathematical and scientific concepts into engaging learning experiences for general audiences.” While a closer look at <i>The Powers of Ten </i>suggests that IBM was likely more motivated by financial and corporate incentives, the importance of education around  technology and science has only become more urgent as their complexity and impact have accelerated. These stakes were captured in a debate that took place at Stanford in 2019 over the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence. The debate’s participants included Yuval Noah Harari, a historian, philosopher, and bestselling author, and Fei-Fei Li, an artificial intelligence pioneer and current co-director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, along with moderator Nicholas Thompson, the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine. In the debate, Harari outlined what he sees as the stakes: an impending “AI crisis” in which technology surpasses or “hacks'' humanity by overriding their free will. Li counters that AI will enhance or benefit humanity, and the debate begins to center around the issue of explainability and the question of whether the risks of AI can be offset if the technologies are adequately explained to the public. Yuval makes the argument that even if the technology could be explained, the explanation would be so complex that no one would be able to understand it. He uses the example of bank loan, suggesting that even if a bank could provide all the statistical calculations an AI used to come to the decision of denying a customer a loan, they wouldn’t be able to comprehend it anyways.  </p>
            <p>Li responds that AI could be used to explain itself before she turns to Thompson, saying “that's why we have people like Nick, the storyteller, to explain… that’s the job of the society collectively, to explain the complex science.” Thompson responds jokingly that his own job will soon be automated and the debate moves on to another topic, but this exchange reveals a key issue. If technology like artificial intelligence poses serious risks, then there is an urgent need to find ways to relate to and potentially critique it -- “to explain the complex science.” Li suggests the solution is storytelling, but as <i>The Powers of Ten </i>demonstrates, narratives, especially those operating under the pretense of objectivity, contain their own political agenda or risks. A Donna Harraway reminds us: 

            “It matters what matters we use to think other matters with; it matters what stories we tell to tell other stories with; it matters what knots knot knots, what thoughts think thoughts, what descriptions describe descriptions, what ties tie ties. It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds make stories.” </p>

            <p>The IBM case study demonstrates the power of graphic design as a frame, and how its legacy of appealing to scientific objectivity has made it a powerful tool for corporate and state actors. The question is if it’s possible to do the opposite. </p>



            <p><strong>Alternatives </strong></p>


            <p>Graphic designs’ innate relationship with vertical perspective and the frame, combined with a historical alignment with science and technology, produces a politics of representation predicated on objectivity, solutionism, and a pretense of transparency. When operationalized from this position, graphic design stabilizes the observer, flattens subjects, and censors information, violence, and perspectives left outside of the frame. This could be understood as a form of realism. According to Fiske, </p>
            <p>“Realism, as a mode of representation, is particularly characteristic of Western cultures and, therefore, in the modern world, of capitalism. It is as powerful and attractive as it is because it grounds our cultural identity in external reality: by making “us” seem real it who we think we are into who we “really” are. To achieve this, it must “know” reality in the way that science “knows” it, as an objective universal whole existence and truth are independent of culture.”  </p>
            <p>To abandon graphic design as realism would destabilize the observer/designer’s position and shift from a politics of knowing and solutionism to an embrace of the unknown. </p>

            <p>In a world in which transparency is not evenly distributed, this might seem like a problem. But if we consider the opacity of systems and subjects alike as a starting point instead of something to be solved, new possibilities emerge. Embracing opacity shifts the role of the designer from objectivity to subjectivity. From neutrality to implication. From scientific to messy. From removed to embodied. From solutionism to something else. </p>

            <p>Frame and perspective. In order to change the dynamic, we must abandon the politics and production of the frame. What is the alternative? Acknowledge the frame and the designers role in its production. Instead of aligning with science and capitalism and producing stable frames, insist on multiple frames. Shifting frames. Destabilized frames. Same for perspective. </p>

            <p>(Need to talk about Forensic Architecture returning and the insistence on many many frames, many perspectives. This enables them to capture evidence that wouldn’t stand up to the light otherwise. They then package it and return it to the state. To the courtroom. To the sphere of public opinion and contestation. Talk about attempts to return this work back to the system. </p>

            <p>What would happen if graphic design shifted in this way? Instead of illusions and false attitudes of objectivity, solutionism, authority, and transparency we would be left with subjectivity and implication and opacity. </p>

            <p>If a single, often aerial perspective constructs an artificially flattened and stable ground, then embracing multiple frames disrupts that illusion. Instead of a fixed or static field, there is space for complexity and abundance. It’s a misconception that opacity is omission or nothing. It’s actually a lot stuff / complexity. This doesn’t offer a solution, but it does demystify things and create space for critique, representation, and sabotage.</p>

            <p>All the stuff that emerges from this, is the subject of my thesis practice. If you take the subject of technological complexity like Facebook and push against the frame what you left with is a pile of stuff. Mundane. Banal. Documents. Infrastructure. Land. Financial abstractions. </p>

            <p>It is a project of excavating, unfolding and unravelling the hegemonies of a material practice deeply entrenched in our cultural, social, and daily contexts. </p>

            <p>The mundane elements of planning and architecture have become tactical tools and the means of dispossession. (5)</p>

            <p>Also within these emerge moments of both violence and human resistance, community, solidarity. </p>

            <p>Under opacity, it’s possible for other forms of evidence. To return to Archives, talk about ephemeral evidence and what it can support. </p>

            <p>The key to queering evidence, and by that I mean the ways in which we prove queerness and read queerness, is by suturing it to the concept of ephemera. Think of ephemera as trace, the remains, the things that are left, hanging in the air like a rumor.</p>

            <p>Jacques Derrida’s idea of the trace is relevant here. Ephemeral evidence is rarely obvious because it is needed to stand against the harsh lights of mainstream visibility and the potential tyranny of the fact.</p>

            <p>Is there more space for the subjenctive outside of the authoritative perspective of design as realism </p>

            <p>“How does one tell impossible stories?” Hartman asks, and she suggests many avenues: “advancing a series of speculative arguments,” “exploiting the capacities of the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that expresses doubts, wishes, and possibilities),” writing history “with and against the archive,” “imagining what cannot be verified.”</p>

            <p>Below here is the writing graveyard 
            / remnants</p>
            <p></p>



            <p>“Design is coming from the decision to publish something, wherever that may be. Every decision to publish is also a decision to frame a message. And design is, however minimalist or baroque it is, often a decision not to do something, to leave something else out. What else is that than high-resolution censorship?”</p>


            <p>A closer look at the design's use of frames may offer some insight. Vertical perspective and use of physical space as substrate has coincided with the trend of using graphic globes and maps as a visual motif divorced from the politics or context of mapping. This is an inevitable consequence of the politics of graphic design. The field is empowered with the authority of scientific accuracy but divorced from the social or political context. For example, the type specimen for Akkurat -- the typeface this book is set in, includes five different types of maps using a graphic element without any context. One reason might be the number of languages the typeface has been expanded to. The description reads: </p>
            <p>“the typeface has been taken to the next level in terms of language support and is now being presented in six entirely new scripts: Cyrillic and Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, and – as a low-hanging fruit – Vietnamese.”</p>
            <p>This description might hint at referencing a map, but the different politics that each map aren’t justified. I think the more likely reason is found in this description: </p>
            <p>L Akkurat aspired to embody qualities such as technical precision, down-to-earth robustness, reliability and neutrality</p>
            <p>The result is the vernacular of science and engineering being treated as a decorative element or formal plaything. </p>
            <p>This is manifested in sites like Boot Boyz Biz, which sell t-shirts, hats, blankets and other soft goods emblazoned with the maps, diagrams, charts, and other aesthetic ephemera of the technical, scientific, or engineered. The company positions itself a design research project, and each item is accompanied by an essay written by the designer. The site description reads: </p>
            <p>Boot Boyz Biz is a project based research practice. Promoting access to ideas and activating ecologies of knowledge is essential to our projects. We see t-shirts as means for a public sphere – tools for generating marginal forms of discourse with a broad social scope.</p>
            <p>Topics covered in the research include cybernetics.</p>
            <p>Products include Kunst und Naturform, a sweatshirt printed with scientific illustrations and paintings, and </p>
            <p>Accompanying design with research is interesting, but few, if any of the essays engage critically with the field or subject matter presented. The designs which are printed on the objects are circulated as divorced from the research presented in the essays. The result is again the aesthetic of science or mapping. Graphic design </p>




            <p>Forensic architecture models this type of practice. They acknowledge architecture as a form of material violence  and the built environment implication in structures of power. Architecture as not just a product of these systems, but as an active agent in their production. Graphic design needs to do the same, with the goal of going one step further. Forensic architecture produces and validates evidence that the state would seek to erase, but also reproduces some of the logic of the state. </p>



            <p>What alternatives are available to this possible story? Push against the frame, shift the politics, reclaim the means of production. The designers on the blanket need to wake up. They should grab onto the frame and commit to different politics. If graphic design is a frame that constructs a certain politics, it’s possible to reverse how it’s being used. If designers take off their white lab coats, and abandon the false promises of design as a solution, different opportunities emerge. </p>

            <p>On two fronts, the designers must fight for change: 1. The designer must shift their relationship with tools, abandoning the authority technology has given and seeking out relationships that offer more control over the means of production. 2.</p>






            <p>Parallel Example in Cybernetics / Machine learning? </p>

            <p>The question of what is and is not included within a frame is a pressing concern in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and specifically within an area called deep learning. If artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to think and learn like humans, then deep learning in a core process that enables this by tackling tricky problems. Some tasks that are easy for humans -- such as identifying an image, are very difficult for machines because they require a sophisticated combination of objective and subjective information. Deep learning is the process of breaking those difficult tasks down into more manageable pieces. For example, an image identification program needed to sort images of tanks, then instead of identifying the tank as whole, deep learning might use a layered model that allows the system to identify individual parts or arrangements of pixels, such as corners and contours of the tank body, or tank cannon barrels. This process enables the deep learning model to break the complexity of the image down into manageable pieces. The process is made possible by a series of thresholds, which are variables that the model sets to determine what is or is not a tank (or a piece of a tank). Functions as an accumulation of frames, each one excluding spam from the dataset. </p>
            <p>Thresholds act like frames, including or excluding certain data. Because this process is embedded within the deep learning model as well as the artificial intelligence model, scientists or engineers are able to distance themselves from the act of setting the threshold or frame. (need some supporting material here) It gives the appearance of neutrality or objectivity. </p>
            <p>Politics of thresholds (they are frames/they pretend to be neutral/they enact violence)</p>
            <p>This is visible in the ways in which white supremacy and other structures of oppression is embedded within AI. Example of Timnit Gebru and the white mask. </p>

            <p>“We cannot understand the field of representability simply by examining its explicit contents, since it is constituted fundamentally by what is left out, maintained outside the frame within which representations appear. We can think of the frame, then, as active, as both jettisoning and presenting, and as doing both at once.” Judith Butler</p>
            <p>This negative or counterform of the output suggests that transparency is itself a form of obfuscation. Graphic design can actually be understood as the production of opacity. It’s not the transmitter, but the noise. It’s not the hidden machine, but the enshrouding black box.</p>

            <p>Return Yuval’s argument that in relationship to complex science and technology, transparency or explanation is really just another form </p>


            <p>In a world in which transparency is not evenly distributed, this might seem like a problem. But if we consider the opacity of systems and subjects alike as a starting point instead of something to be solved, new possibilities emerge </p>
            <p>Embracing opacity shifts the role of the designer from objectivity to subjectivity. From neutrality to implication. From scientific to messy. From removed to embodied. From solutionism to something else. In my practice, I deliberately leverage design’s production of opacity as a productive site for facilitating relationships between networks, objects, systems,and people on these new terms.</p>














            <p>“Realism, as a mode of representation, is particularly characteristic of Western cultures and, therefore, in the modern world, of capitalism. It is as powerful and attractive as it is because it grounds our cultural identity in external reality: by making “us” seem real it who we think we are into who we “really” are. To achieve this, it must “know” reality in the way that science “knows” it, as an objective universal whole existence and truck are independent of culture.”            </p>
            <p>“A culture of power is a culture of representation. The intellectual, ethical, religious discourses of power may well tend towards high art (great representations), and their more economic, pragmatic ones towards industrialized art (mass representations), but both rely on their ability to produce representations of the world, and more importantly if less explicitly, of themselves in the world.” </p>
