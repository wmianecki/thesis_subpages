        <p class="intro">Ingrid Burrington is an artist who writes, makes maps, and tells jokes about places, politics, and the weird feelings people have about both. She’s the author of Networks of New York, an illustrated field guide to urban internet infrastructure, and has previously written for The Atlantic, The Nation, The Verge, and other outlets. Her work has previously been supported by Eyebeam Art and Technology Center, the Center for Land Use Interpretation, and Rhizome. We spoke over Zoom on April 12, 2021.</p>

        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span> <br> lot of my thesis work and research has revolved around network infrastructure and other infrastructures as an avenue to critique or understand tech platforms and the systems they are produced by. Sometimes, I find that people are surprised that I am so interested in a topic others might find boring or mundane. As someone who is well known for their work in the area of network infrastructure, among other topics, I’m curious what drew you into that world? And what, if anything, keeps you engaged?</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br>  I think the misunderstanding that infrastructure is boring is perpetuated by an assumption that infrastructure is a neutral entity. That it is something that doesn’t necessarily bear politics, which is obviously not the case. The entire history of transportation design in the United States refutes that entirely, and the internet is no exception either. My interest was piqued in 2013, when a lot of the Edward Snowden documents were coming out.[1] I was coming out of being very deep in lefty activist circles in New York City. I was around Occupy Wall Street and people who were getting FBI visits for organizing marches. At the time, [the Snowden] stories had a big impact on that community. I remember getting very interested in the business model [of surveillance] It’s not that they wouldn’t exist otherwise. It’s just that after 9/11, the military contractor industry exploded, and tech opportunities also increased dramatically. Initially, I was interested in that. I was also interested in the visual vernacular around surveillance and surveillance technologies. When the Snowden story started dropping, it tended to have art attached to it that was either images of the PowerPoints, which were themselves these sort of fascinating representations of the banality of infrastructure: It’s just shitty clipart. I remember seeing a few projects at the time by graphic designers who were saying: “I made nicer slides.” They missed the point. I don’t really know what that intervention was going for. If it wasn’t the banal slides, it was stock imagery of people in hoodies at laptops, or a close-up shot of some source code. A really popular one was just the jQuery source code, which I find fascinating: “Ah, yes, the core tool for sneaking around and spying on people: the toggle button.”</p>
        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        (laughing) That’s really funny.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br class="calibre3" />
        I found a lot of that imagery really frustrating as I got more into learning about all of these companies, and the revolving door of people working in the intelligence community and then at these companies, as well as the broader ecosystem that perpetuated the need for more surveillance because you could keep making money. That world is actually quite aesthetically dull. I did a little project in 2013, where I went to take photographs of this office park that’s next to the NSA. It’s just defense contractors. It’s Booz Allen Hamilton, Northrop Grumman, everyone you can think of is there. It’s pretty ugly. It’s got some really shitty public sculptures. I think of that work in the same vein as the stuff Robert Smithson was doing in the 1970s, his obsession with construction and the suburban environment as non-site. That standardization of architecture and landscape that lends itself to entropy. Through that, I got into network infrastructure, because the thing that happens when you’re driving around Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland, looking for defense contractors, is that you also find data centers. There was also an interesting discourse in 2013 around whether you should find the state or corporate surveillance concerning. I don’t think that’s really the point. That’s a question that people can address for themselves, but the question of how does power work, in terms of who owns all of the materials through which communication happens? That was my entry point.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">I was looking at this thing that was being hyped as sexy and important, but not being explained in its banality, which heightened the sexy, spooky, story quality of it, but also made it easier for people to just stay scared. It sort of missed the point. The impact of the big dragnet surveillance stuff, it’s there, and it’s real, and it’s fucked up, but ultimately, it’s at best adjacent to the actual violence that the state perpetuates on a daily basis. The opportunities for the surveillance of things that are hidden in plain sight, like the content that you’re just publicly posting, is also pretty high. A lot of this all bottoms out in who owns the most stuff. I’m working on an essay[2] where I’m experimenting with what happens when you replace the word infrastructure in tech press releases with “the means of production.” It turns out that a lot of the time, it’s pretty much the same.</p>
        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        That’s really interesting.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br class="calibre3" />
        It’s more complicated than that, and the semantics of infrastructure is a very tedious subject, but I do think there is something interesting about the way that that word has been instrumentalized over the last 20 years. Right now it’s really funny watching Democrats and Republicans argue about: is this infrastructure? Welcome to fucking media studies, guys.</p>
        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        I have really enjoyed your podcast RIP Corp[3]. One of my favorite episodes is about the retailer Claire’s, and its journey through bankruptcy. There’s a great moment, near the end of that episode, after you have unpacked all of this financial abstraction, where you concede that even you, as the host, have completely lost interest. That was so funny and relatable - the struggle of running up against banality or abstraction. How do you get around that problem and approach the issue of explainability? And do you think that this is an issue that’s getting worse? That we’re facing a world of accelerating abstraction and complexity?</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br> One of the reasons I got past it was because that show is not just me, I have producers. (laughing) There were other people who said, we have to finish this. I think it is the trick of being a good storyteller. It’s about how you make something interesting rhetorically. Sometimes I find that stuff a little bit annoying: “Behold, the seemingly ordinary building is actually a portal to the beyond.” It can be a bit cheap, but I do think that there is value to the slightly Gonzo or absurdist approach. When I was doing some of the defense contractor work, I was explicitly thinking of Smithson and The Monuments of Passaic, where he’s writing about a construction site as a lost ruin of an ancient city. Taking it as far as: “I think I might be going insane as I gaze upon the Booz Allen Hamilton property.” And sometimes it does feel that way. There is a big mindfuck in being in an environment that is so dull, and yet has so much capital.<br><p class="name2"><span class='name2'>There is a big mindfuck in being in an environment that is so dull, and yet has so much capital.</span></p>  There’s an Amazon Web Services (AWS) property that’s next to a pet resort in Virginia. That’s one of my favorites. There’s a fucking dog hotel next door to a node in the apparatus of Jeff Bezos’s wealth. The banality can actually take the abstraction and ground it in a way that makes it much more enchanting, because in fact, Jeff Bezos does not live in a magical hovercraft above all of us. He has properties. He lives in an apartment, or several apartments and probably some boats. The labor that happens is in fact, quite dull, and has to be situated amongst a bunch of other things.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">In terms of whether that’s going to get harder, I think it’s just a persistent problem. I think that there’s just new kinds of abstraction. There’s a question of how deep any particular audience needs to go. With the private equity stuff, the depth to which somebody like Stephen Lerner, the organizer who I interviewed for that episode, goes is valuable, because his endgame is working with employees from retail and other sectors who are being fucked by private equity, and being able to meet them on their terms. Being able to understand what to argue about. Because if you don’t understand the sleight of hand that happens in all of those financial abstractions, then you don’t understand how that’s going to trickle back to you. For a person who just needs to understand, why did this company go bankrupt? You can have a lighter touch. Just saying, “These are dumb games to make money out of money, and also make negative money, but it’s real money. And all of this is fake” is probably going to suffice. (laughing) It just depends on the level of curiosity of your audience.</p>
        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        I recently interviewed Cameron La Follette[4], who is the director of the Oregon Coast Alliance, and we talked about how, in order to get the permits to build a subsea cable landing site in Tierra del Mar on the coast of Oregon, Facebook had to prove that they were a utility. Do you think the frame of a utility is useful for understanding companies like Google, Amazon, or Facebook? What do you think a productive frame might be?</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span> <br class="calibre3" />I’m very ambivalent about the positioning of a utility or not. Partly because I think that it creates conditions where these companies are essentially too big to fail. When Facebook talks about what they do as social infrastructure, it’s comparing them to a library or community center, and you wouldn’t just shut down the library. The fact of the matter is, there was a world before Facebook that functioned. I have yet to hear a compelling reason why Facebook needs to keep existing. I have heard compelling, short-term reasons. But in the long term, I have yet to hear an argument that makes me think, “Yes, this should exist in perpetuity, forever.” At the same time, I think that the initial impulse to label these companies as utilities emerged from a belief that we could flip them. Facebook called itself a social utility for a while, back in 2007, pre-IPO. Danah Boyd has a blog post deep in her personal website from 2010[5] on how Facebook is a social utility, so we should regulate it like one. Companies very quickly moved away from that, from the word utility and towards infrastructure, because infrastructure is nebulous enough to avoid regulation.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">I am also wary of the idea that we should just put the state in charge of the social media platforms. I don’t think that the problem is that we need a different centralized owner. The very premise of how communications as utilities are governed is not really well thought out. I initially came to infrastructure-related language thinking that it was a useful way to start reframing the way that people thought about companies as beholden to a public. At this point, companies have absorbed that language and rhetoric effectively enough that it’s actually kind of in their interest to continue to perpetuate terms like infrastructure for what they’re doing.</p>
        <p style="padding-left:10%; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM </span><br class="calibre3" />One thing I didn’t expect, and maybe this was naive, is how layered contemporary network infrastructure is. The idea of a company operating at the level of underground cables all the way up to satellite projects with lots of financial abstraction and other layers in between wasn’t how I was thinking about a company like Facebook operating before I got into the research.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br class="calibre3" />
        I think that this maybe goes back to the thing I was saying earlier about infrastructure versus means of production. The fact is, none of these companies could do what they’re doing if they didn’t have a lot of items. That sounds very video gamey.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">One of the things that I worry about is how companies and people in tech treat the word infrastructure. On the one hand, there are softwares that support other softwares. I accept that there are infra-supra relationships all the way down the stack, but I also think that the proposition of building alternatives to these large companies, which have accrued so much power, absent an acknowledgment of all of the stuff you need, is a bit foolish.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">Distributed peer-to-peer protocols are really cool. However, most people don’t want to cache most of the network on their personal laptop, and most consumer hardware isn’t designed for that. Most consumer broadband isn’t designed for that either. It is in companies’ interests to de-emphasize the stuff, or as they’re emphasizing the stuff, to do so in a way that creates the narrative that they are being trustworthy and reliable rather than powerful. The mythos around Silicon Valley that you can just bootstrap yourself into making billions of dollars ignores that in order to be able to do that, you need a lot of computers. You need a lot of electricity. You need items. You need to accrue capital. It’s not that this is surprising, it’s just that it’s not necessarily treated as the point of intervention.</p>

        <p class="name2"><span class='name2'>The mythos around Silicon Valley that you can just bootstrap yourself into making billions of dollars ignores that in order to be able to do that, you need a lot of computers. You need a lot of electricity. You need items. You need to accrue capital. It’s not that this is surprising, it’s just that it’s not necessarily treated as the point of intervention.</span></p>
   

        <p style="padding-left:40px; class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        That’s a great way of framing things, focusing on all of the materiality, on all of the stuff. And maybe that links back to how narratives around infrastructure or tech companies often exclude the banal if favor of sexier but more reductive narratives.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br> The reason it’s useful to make those distinctions is to understand what you want to change. Sometimes people will say infrastructure when they mean system. Sometimes the word infrastructure becomes a way of saying “a thing that people take for granted.” Or “a thing that lots of people ignore but that needs to be understood as important.” Far be it for me to say don’t take things for granted that are boring, that’s obviously my whole deal. I do think that understanding how something exists within state and capital dynamics is important. It informs your critique.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br> That’s a great point. I was reminded of some of some of your writing and its specific language following the recent news about an attempted bombing of Amazon Web Services data centers. It made me think of your article “Effortless Slippage,” in which you write about the importance of “not only constructing alternative infrastructure, but mapping, sabotaging, and expropriating.” How do you think about something like sabotage? How does that language inform your work or critique?</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span> I think that there are interesting opportunities for very strategic sabotage of large platform’s infrastructure. A big, spectacular, blow-out is not actually strategic. In the long run, that will just lead to greater security theater around these spaces and is going to make them more inaccessible. And you’ll probably just end up going to federal prison.</p>
        <p class="name2"><span class='name2'>Sustained, small-scale annoyance is something that has a lot of interesting potential.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre1">Sustained, small-scale annoyance is something that has a lot of interesting potential, because the reason people use Facebook is that it’s there, and it’s reliable, and all of their friends are there. So if Facebook is unavailable for two hours one day, and then it’s unavailable for four hours another day, if there’s just these intermittent and frequent interruptions, people will inevitably think: I can’t get to my support group. Or, I’m an admin on some obscure kind of cancer page and we really need to be able to support each other. So I’m moving us to like this forum service. Or if you’re an organizer and your activist calls to get people to come to protests are supposed to be happening on Facebook, then you’re not going to reach people effectively if you can’t get on this website, so maybe you make a mailing list or you’re pounding the pavement instead. People will find other ways to do what they need to do.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">That’s actually harmful to Facebook. Facebook becoming less convenient is actually the way to attack their authority and power because, if there are fewer people there, they cannot justify selling ads that will reach billions of eyeballs. I’ve described this to other people and they said that sounds like the plot of a very good YA novel.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br> (laughing) That would be a sophisticated YA novel.</p>

       

        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br> (laughing) Ragtag, autonomous cells traveling the world quietly cutting cables. That’s not a level of sophistication that I think a lot of people bring to sabotage. The AWS guy, he was almost right. He was so close, but then he really fucked it up. He didn’t seem like a particularly smart dude, and kind of seemed like a bad person. I think he was one of the Capitol protest guys. That being said, I think that when it’s the FBI selling you the C4 it’s kind of shady to say you did a crime. You wouldn’t have bought the C4 if an undercover agent hadn’t been like: “Hi, I have C4.” Not to mention that the FBI loses an opportunity. If they really wanted to, they could wait until this guy did find a supplier and then arrest the guy and the fucking supplier.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br> That’s a good point!</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br class="calibre3" />
        The language of sabotage and expropriation that I use in that essay, some of it is a deliberate provocation. What would a cooperatively owned Facebook be? Could it even function? Is it worth making that provocation just to get into the ins and outs of: what kind of internet you want to build?</p>
        <p class="calibre1">I’ve been thinking a lot about what a cooperative Amazon Web Services is? It’s basically just Anarcho-syndicalism. Surprise, I invented a centuries-old concept! If it’s a business to business thing, you would have all the companies pitch in to run a data center collectively. I think that there is a sort of resignation in a lot of the critique that assumes that Facebook just can, will, and maybe even must exist forever. It’s boring, it’s very short-sighted, and it’s sort of sad.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br class="calibre3" />
        Just the suggestion of sabotage points to the materiality of these systems. That they are in some ways constructed and malleable.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br> You’d still have to do a lot of it at scale for it to be meaningful. You don’t actually have to be a country to [sabotage]. You would have to be a country if you wanted to knock out everything simultaneously for an extended period of time. At that point, you’re talking about multiple properties being destroyed in coordinated attacks. That’s nation-state level shit.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>WM</span><br> One of the projects I am finishing up this semester is based on a subtle form of sabotage. It’s inspired by a YouTube video of an engineer who figured out that if you shout in a datacenter too close to the server racks, it creates measurable performance issues. Something about that is funny to me. The idea that frustrated employees working in data centers could shout and accidentally sabotage something, even in a small way.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br> There’s so much of the “work inside these companies to make them better [attitude].” Nah dog, work inside these companies and then shoot your shot. This is no longer fixable. I think that point has been proven over and over again. I just finished reading the Guardian profile of a woman who left Facebook and wrote a scathing goodbye letter and came forward as a whistleblower. I’m just like, man, I give this three days in the media cycle, and then everyone’s going to forget. I don’t know how many more whistles you can blow.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">I don’t think that any of the improvements to this are going to happen at or in Facebook. That’s not happening. If it hasn’t happened now, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">It’s almost frustrating how difficult it can be to draw people’s attention to network infrastructure and then there’s a news story like the AWS bombing attempt, and suddenly, it’s a front page news story.</p>
        <p class="calibre1"><span class='name'>IB</span><br>
           Infrastructure is important when it’s on fire. Another thing that drew me to the infrastructure stuff in 2014 or 2015, and kept me on that path, was a feeling that: something is broken. It’s not the buildings, but the way this is all going seems to not be working for a lot of people. Looking at how this whole thing actually works is one way to start to think about a diagnosis.</p>
